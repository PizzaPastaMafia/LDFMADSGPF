A pyhton program to keep track of the albums you listened to.

Frontend made with gtk, peewee for database managing and last.fm api.

when you run the program for the first time, run STARTUP.sh to install the
dependencies, then you can just run main.py

you can add albums, give them a vote and there's also a favourite's view.

have fun!
